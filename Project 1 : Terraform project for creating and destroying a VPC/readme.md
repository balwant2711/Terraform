# 🌐 Create & Destroy VPC using Terraform  

This project demonstrates how to **create and destroy an AWS VPC** using **Terraform**, showcasing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. It is a beginner-friendly yet powerful use case that highlights automation, reproducibility, and scalability in cloud infrastructure management.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
- ✅ Automates the creation of a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** in AWS.  
- ✅ Configures **subnets, internet gateway, and route tables**.  
- ✅ Supports **terraform apply** (to create resources) and **terraform destroy** (to remove resources).  
- ✅ Demonstrates the use of **variables, providers, and resource blocks** in Terraform.  
- ✅ Helps beginners understand the **end-to-end IaC workflow**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code tool  
- **AWS** – Cloud platform  
- **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** – Used for writing Terraform scripts
